# File.io Android App
[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/845a73f559a747279016b83c41a78446)](https://www.codacy.com/app/rumaan/file.io-app?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=rumaan/file.io-app&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

This simple app allows you to upload any file and get a _sharable_ link with a set expiration time.
The file will be **Deleted** after its downloaded or after expiration time (regardless of whether its downloaded or not).
This app is made with the help of [file.io](https://file.io) which is an **_Anonymous_, _Secure_** file sharing platform by [Humbly](http://humbly.com/).
